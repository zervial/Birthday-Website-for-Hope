      <h1 class="envelopeParagraph">Happy Birthday Hope!</h1>
      <p class="envelopeParagraph">It's your birthday! I don't know if you even want to be reading something I made, but I wanted to make something for you. I was hesitant to make a website because I was unsure if you'd prefer a letter instead. Maybe you do, but I'm not sure how'd I give it to you considering we are on a break right now. I do want to give you more for you birthday other than this website, but I think I'll wait until we can talk IRL again. <br> <br>
      To start, I want to apologize again for anything I've said or done that hurt you. I stupidly neglected your feelings and made you feel uncomfortable around me. It's my fault that you felt the need to take a two week break and I never want you to feel that way again. I want to be a better person in the future for you. I want to love you in a way that makes both of us happy and I'm sorry that I couldn't. <br> <br>
      But enough of that, it's your birthday! You mentioned your mom saying that she wanted to have a big celebration thing (forgot the name) for your seventeenth birthday, so if you do, then I hope you enjoy it! This past two weeks have been filled with me missing you a lot. Whenever something good happened I wanted to share it with you, but I know you'd probably not want to talk. There has been so much things I wish I could've talked about, so whenever we feel comfortable with talking again IRL, I want to tell you all about them! This past weeks have made me realized how much I took for granted. I miss talking to you about something that happened. I miss talking to you when I felt like celebrating something. I miss talking to you when I found a good manga I wanted to yap about. Thank you for always listening to me. I'm sorry for taking what we had for granted. Even if we don't hold hands as much, I still want to sit there next to you and just be able to talk. I still want to, of course, but I'm not sure how that would make you feel now. I miss hearing your laugh and the feeling of your hand.<br> <br>
      I hope you can forgive me for everything I did that hurt you. I hope you can forgive me for taking you for granted. I hope you can forgive me for not being the person you wanted me to be. I want to be better for you and I want to be better for myself. I want to be the type of person that can make both of us happy. I hope we can talk again soon, but if not, then I hope you have a great birthday. <br> <br>
      I love you and I miss you. I hope you have a great birthday and I hope you can forgive me for everything. <br> <br>

     <p>I had lessons on making a website and a stray thought popped into my mind: what if I made a website for Hope? I delayed this idea until a week ago when it came back into my head. It was an absolutely daunting task and I definitley felt like giving up a lot. Learning enough HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website was pretty hard, but worth it. <br> <br>
      I really hope you like this stupid little project! <br> <br>
      (ps: I made all of this within 5 days so I'm sorry for all the bugs and mistakes.) <br> <br>
